                "Celebrate with us in the Air Max 1. Lemon wash and bright accents of mantra orange playfully portray Mexican marigolds, also known as cempascitol. Widely used in Mexico's Day of the Dead festival, the flower is believed to be a sign that guides the souls of the deceased into the world. Speaking of marigolds, also note the debossed floral graphics around the mudguard. It adds a lively touch and pays further homage to Mexican traditions. Don't worry when the sun goes down and it gets dark. A glow-in-the-dark outsole completes the outfit with a candlelit look. In our memories and in our hearts, we will always be \"Somos Familia\" (we are family).",

Since its birth in 1982, the Air Force 1 has been deeply associated with the world's most influential music genre, hip-hop, and has become a uniform presence in that culture. The dubre is stamped with two important dates: 1973 and 1982. It highlights the now widely known beginning year of hip-hop and Air Force 1. In addition, the Swoosh and wide shoelaces were used to create a sense of unity by scratching the record, and the thickness of the shoelaces determined \"coolness\".",
